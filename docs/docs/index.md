# ChemPred

### Overview

`ChemPred` ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/BernalFA/chempred)) is a Python package comprising a set of tools for automatic evaluation of different machine learning models with focus on chemistry-related tasks. Taking advantage of the pipelining capabilities offered by [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [`imbalanced-learn`](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/), and [`scikit-mol`](https://github.com/EBjerrum/scikit-mol), `ChemPred` offers performance comparisons on pipelines created using several molecular featurization methods, different machine learning algorithms, and class balancing options (in case of classification problems).

### Installation

`ChemPred` relies on several external Python packages as described above, which are already included as dependencies. Thus, installation from source is possible as usual.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/BernalFA/chempred.git
$ cd chempred
$ pip install .
```
